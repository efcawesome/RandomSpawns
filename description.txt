Ever wanted to be constantly afraid during your playthroughs? Well fear not, as this mod makes every boss spawn naturally under certain conditions, just like how the Eye of Cthulhu or the Mechanical Bosses do in vanilla.

Works with vanilla, calamity, and thorium bosses!

~~ Conditions ~~  
(If you don't want to be spoiled on when the bosses are going to spawn, don't read this portion)

(By default, bosses cannot spawn naturally once they have been defeated)

All conditions can be modified in the config of this mod if desired.
